This is the lightweight FORTRAN library of the

Department Computational Hydrosystems
Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ
Permoserstr. 15
04318 Leipzig, Germany

One can produce a browseable html of the library in the directory html by calling: make SRCPATH=. html

The library is maintained with a versioning system at:
https://git.ufz.de/chs/fortran

For running on Windows under Cygwin:
The link files on the SVN server are *nix style. One has to redo them on Windows.
In cygwin, in the directory FORTRAN_chs_lib do:
    for i in $(find . -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name mo_\* -print) ; do if [[ $(head -1 $i | cut -f 1 -d ' ') == link ]] ; then cd $(dirname $i) ; ln -sf ../$(basename $i) ; cd .. ; fi ; done
    for i in $(find . -mindepth 3 -maxdepth 3 -name mo_\* -print) ; do if [[ $(head -1 $i | cut -f 1 -d ' ') == link ]] ; then cd $(dirname $i) ; ln -sf ../../$(basename $i) ; cd ../.. ; fi ; done
    cd test/test_mo_kernel ; ln -sf ../../nr_chs/golden.f90 ; cd ../..
Please do not commit these files because it will break the Library everywhere else except on Cygwin.
